I've got one month left on Cape before I leave!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So Pedro is how I feel: tired, emotional, trying to survive. Not pictured: many moments of joy.

### [April Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/March-2025-Goals/)

- Submitted paper to ICB!
- [Examined the impact of demographic variables for revision](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2024-Part44/)
- [Updated figures](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2024-Part45/)
- Submitted the revision to ICB!

**West Coast Green Crab Experiment**:

- [Extracted all RNA samples!](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2023-Part60/)
- [Found and consolidated all metabolomics samples and sent them for sequencing!](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2023-Part59/)
- [Tested library preparation kit](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2023-Part61/) over [two days](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2023-Part63/)
- [Started preparing sample libraries](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2023-Part64/)

**Perspective Piece**:

- Submitted perspective piece to ICB!

### July Goals

**West Coast Green Crab Experiment**:

- Determine why my library preparation keeps having low yield
- Finish prepping remaining libraries
- Re-prep any libraries that require it
- Re-amplify samples with low but acceptable yields
- Pool libraries
- Send libraries for sequencing

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- Finish -omics integration analysis
- Finish -omics and physiology integration analysis
- Update methods
- Update results
- Write discussion
- Write introduction
- Write abstract

**Other**:

- Update my website
- Make Bluesky

### Back Burner

I haven't worked on these projects in a while, but they are next on my to-do list. I don't think they need to be in the deep freeze so I guess I gotta turn the back burner on!

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

- Revise `methylKit code`
- Run `bismark` with the new *C. gigas* genome
- Update methods and results
- Revise discussion
- Revise introduction
- Revise abstract

### Deep Freeze

Things that are not immediate enough to be on the backburner, so they're stuck in the deep freeze.

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

These are things I need to do and can probably knock out in a week, but I think they're a lower priority right now for me since there's more momentum on other projects. At the very least, I need to reach out to collaborators and get this going again.

- Revise abstract
- Write discussion
- Write introduction
