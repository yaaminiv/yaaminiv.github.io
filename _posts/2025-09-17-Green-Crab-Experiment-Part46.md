## Intergrating physiology data with WCNA

I want to tie average TTR and respirometry information with metabololite and lipid profiles. My plan is to find a way to add that information into the WCNA first, then see if I can do something similar with and ASCA or DIABLO to also tie the metabolomics and lipidomics data together. All my work was done in [this script](https://github.com/yaaminiv/green-crab-metabolomics/blob/main/code/07-integration-analysis.Rmd).

### Format input data

The first thing I wanted to do was format my TTR and respirometry data in a format similar to the metabolomics and lipidomics data used for WCNA! The big thing was ensuring that all of the treatment columns were similar:

In this process, I needed to grab the sampling information from the TTR metadata. Looking at this, I noticed two things:

```{r}
rawTTR <- read.csv("../../data/time-to-right.csv", header = TRUE) #Import raw data

modTTR <- rawTTR %>%
  mutate(., day = case_when(date == "7/8/2022" ~ 4,
                            date == "7/12/2022" ~ 8,
                            date == "7/15/2022" ~ 11,
                            date == "7/19/2022" ~ 15,
                            date == "7/22/2022" ~ 18,
                            date == "7/26/2022" ~ 22)) %>%
  mutate(., treatment = case_when(treatment.tank == "1" | treatment.tank == "4" ~ "13C",
                                  treatment.tank == "2" | treatment.tank == "5" ~ "5C",
                                  treatment.tank == "3" | treatment.tank == "6" ~ "30C")) %>%
  mutate(., missing.legs = case_when(number.legs < 10 ~ "Y",
                                     number.legs == 10 ~ "N")) %>%
  mutate(., integument.cont = recode(integument.color,
                                     "B" = 0,
                                     "BG" = 0.5,
                                     "G" = 1, 
                                     "YG" = 1.5, 
                                     "Y" = 2, 
                                     "YO" = 2.5 , 
                                     "O" = 3, 
                                     "RO" = 3.5)) %>%
  mutate(., trial.1 = na_if(trial.1, 91.00)) %>%
  mutate(., trial.2 = na_if(trial.2, 91.00)) %>%
  mutate(., trial.3 = na_if(trial.3, 91.00)) %>%
  rowwise(.) %>% 
  mutate(., TTRavg = mean(c(trial.1, trial.2, trial.3), na.rm = TRUE)) %>%

  mutate(., TTRavgFullLow = TTRavgFull - TTRSEFull) %>%
  mutate(., TTRavgFullHigh = TTRavgFull + TTRSEFull) %>%
  ungroup(.) #Remove sampling ID and notes columns. Add new column with day information. Add new column with treatment information. Create a a new column that with an index for width/length. Create new column as a binary for whether or not crabs are missing legs. Change all 91 to NA, calculate average and SE using data from the three TTR trials using rowwise operations, and remove rows where TTRavg | TTRSE = NA.  Calculate average and SE for all samples in a treatment for each day. Add/subtract TTRSEFull to/from TTRavgFull to get bounds. Ungroup.

```

1. My 5ÂºC samples weren't necessarily placed in the correct tubes. But I remember correcting the tube labels to actually match the samples when sending them in, so that's set.
2. I TOOK MY SAMPLES ON DAY 4, NOT DAY 3!!

Noticing this error, I also went back to the experimental design and PLSDA figures and made necessary changes. This involved changing the InDesign documents, not any R code or output figure because I was thinking about efficiency.

When trying to create trait matrices to correlate with WCNA, I also noticed that there were some discrepancies. At one point, I had multiple crabs labelled 302 and 303. I ended up fixing this error in the TTR datasheet pretty easily, since 301-303 and 304-onwards were sampled on different days! When merging dataframes, I noticed that crabs 304, 308, and 506 were all discarded from the TTR analysis since they failed to right. However, 304 had respirometry information, so I had to go in manually to ensure that label still existed in the final trait matrix.

### Get correlations between WCNA modules and with physiology

I wanted to correlate metabolite and lipid profiles with average TTR and respirometry data on the days the crabs were dissected in three steps:

1. Metabolomics and lipidomics WCNAs separately, correlate with physiology data only
2. Metabolomics and lipidomics WCNAs separately, correlate with physiology and treatment data
3. Combined metabolomics and lipidomics WCNAs

The main difference between the first two points were purely visualization. My visualizations are below:

**Figures 1-2**. Correlations between metabolomics modules and physiology only, or metabolomics modules and physiology and treatment information

Comparing Figure 2 with the existing manuscript figures, I noticed that the correlation and P-values were different for the treatment x module correlations! However, the physiology correlations were consistent, which was to be expect. After breaking my brain, my guess was because I was using an updated R version and updated package versions in this round. I tried combining the correlations from physiology alone (derived today) and with the already saved information with the existing temperature WCNA output. I could then combine those two correlation matrices in a heatmap:

**Figure 3**. Existing module-trait correlations with new physiology data appended for metabolomics

I'm going to stick with this figure for now since it will allow me to maintain consistency between analyses I've done previously with the new analysis!

I did all the same things for the lipidomics data:

**Figures 4-6**. Correlations between lipidomics modules and physiology only, physiology and temperature from today, and physiology appended onto previous temperature correlations.





### Going forward
