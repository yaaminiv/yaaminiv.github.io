### [December Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/December-2025-Goals/)

**West Coast Green Crab Experiment**:

- [Finished initial metabolomics analysis and started writing results!](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2023-Part82/)
- [Started transcriptome assembly...it was a time](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2023-Part81/)
- Made my SICB talk!

**Plan Biol 191**:

- Created a giant plan for the course
- Used the TILT assignment framework to make assignment instructions
- Made a functioning Camino site
- Did not prep my course material ahead of time because I was very tired. Guess I'll reap the consequences.

**Other**:

- Did not do any lab organization. Womp womp.

### January Goals

**Pilot Green Crab Experiment**:

- Address Carolyn's feedback on the manuscript (abstract through discussion)
- Finalize the supplementary material

**West Coast Green Crab Experiment**:

- Finish *trinity* transcriptome assembly
- Determine methods for getting advanced assembly statistics
- Determine methods for getting transcriptome annotations
- Get advanced assembly statistics
- Get transcriptome annotations

**Biol 195**:

Ashray will develop R analysis skills by analyzing the demographic data and temperature logger data from the 2023 experiment. Once he's comfortable in R, he will start working with the gene expression data in DESeq2.

- Find resources for `tidyverse` and `ggplot`
- Outline structured tasks for demographic dataset
- Create a lab notebook template

**Project Lab**:

- Week 1 content
- Week 2 content
- Week 3 content
- Week 4 content
- Week 5 content
- Week 6 content

**Other**

- Complete review for Molecular Ecology
- Complete review for Marine Environmental Research
- Get Oceans course material from Dawn
- Finalize field trip dates
- Arrange field trip transportation

### Back Burner

I haven't worked on these projects in a while, but they are next on my to-do list. I don't think they need to be in the deep freeze so I guess I gotta turn the back burner on!

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

- Revise `methylKit code`
- Run `bismark` with the new *C. gigas* genome
- Update methods and results
- Revise discussion
- Revise introduction
- Revise abstract

### Deep Freeze

Things that are not immediate enough to be on the backburner, so they're stuck in the deep freeze.

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

These are things I need to do and can probably knock out in a week, but I think they're a lower priority right now for me since there's more momentum on other projects. At the very least, I need to reach out to collaborators and get this going again.

- Revise abstract
- Write discussion
- Write introduction
