One month as faculty down!

### [September Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/September-2025-Goals/)

**Onboarding**:

- Completed all necessary trainings and set up office
- Started purging through lab equipment, but haven't gotten a chance to reorganize
- Signed up for new PI promos but have yet to order any equipment
- Almost finalized recirculating seawater system order

**Teaching**:

- Reviewed 1C lab structure
- Survived the first lab section and did some grading (s/o to the 1C team for making this transition painless!)

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- [Revised TTR and respirometry analyses](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-Part44/)
- [Added dispersion analysis to metabolomics and lipidomics perMANOVAs](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-Part45/)
- [Integrate physiology data with existing temperature WCNAs](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-Part46/)
- [Tried a combined metabolomics-lipidomics WCNA to understand physiology-temperature-molecular connections](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-Part47/)
- [Performed a DIABLO with metabolomics and lipidomics data](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-Part48/)

**Other**:

- [CREATED MY LAB WEBSITE AND I LOVE HER!](https://yaaminiv.github.io/mmep-lab/)
- Provided Christelle information to update my bio on the department website
- Joined New PI Slack
- Started the FSP to learn how to thrive in this job!
- Connected with other California green crab researchers!

### October Goals

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- Try ASCA analysis
- Outline discussion
- Write discussion
- Outline introduction
- Write introduction
- Modify abstract
- Send first draft to Carolyn!

**Biol 1C**:

- Keep grading
- Keep reviewing lecture content

**Plan Biol 195**:

I'm incorporating all of my lab set up tasks into planning Biol 195, because I need to acquire experimental equipment for the lab and for the course. I'll also need to think about which things are course-specific versus which things are lab specific, hence the combined framework.

- Get CDFW permit
- Purchase molecular equipment
- Purchase physiology equipment
- Send Daryn list of class-specific equipment
- Finalize recirculating seawater system
- Sort through existing sample and falcon tubes
- Draft syllabus

**West Coast Green Crab Experiment**:

- Revise physiology data analysis
- Get SCU cluster access
- Take RNA-Seq data through HiSat2
- Take metabolomics data through WCNA

### Back Burner

I haven't worked on these projects in a while, but they are next on my to-do list. I don't think they need to be in the deep freeze so I guess I gotta turn the back burner on!

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

- Revise `methylKit code`
- Run `bismark` with the new *C. gigas* genome
- Update methods and results
- Revise discussion
- Revise introduction
- Revise abstract

### Deep Freeze

Things that are not immediate enough to be on the backburner, so they're stuck in the deep freeze.

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

These are things I need to do and can probably knock out in a week, but I think they're a lower priority right now for me since there's more momentum on other projects. At the very least, I need to reach out to collaborators and get this going again.

- Revise abstract
- Write discussion
- Write introduction
