## Google Gemini for literature search launch pad

I'm trying something new today: Using Google Gemini as a starting place
for literature searches (using SCU's subscription since our queries will
not be mined for data).

### Gemini search for metabolite roles in the cell membrane

> I have a list of metabolites. For these metabolites, 1) state if it is
> a saturated, monounsaturated, or polyunsaturated fatty acid; 2)
> describe their role in the cell membrane; and 3) describe their role
> in crustaceans. If there is no described role in crustaceans, describe
> the role in arthropods generally. For 2) and 3), provide links to
> journal articles. adipic acid arachidic acid glutamic acid
> heptadecanoic acid salicylic acid stearic acid terephthalic acid

| Metabolite | Fatty Acid Type (1) | Role in Cell Membrane (2) | Role in Crustaceans/Arthropods (3) |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| Adipic Acid | Not a fatty acid (It is a dicarboxylic acid) | No direct structural role; generally used in industrial synthesis (e.g., Nylon). | Limited direct biological role; may be a xenobiotic metabolite in some organisms. |
| Arachidic Acid | Saturated Fatty Acid (C20:0) | Contributes to membrane rigidity and stability, primarily in the non-polar core of the lipid bilayer due to its saturation and long chain length. | Precursor to key signaling molecules(eicosanoids) in arthropods, particularly important for immune responses and reproductive processes, though it is often present in minor quantities. |
| Glutamic Acid | Not a fatty acid (It is an amino acid) | Transporters regulate its homeostasis across the membrane; it is an essential component for GSH synthesis and a key neurotransmitter in vertebrates. | Essential building block for proteinsand a major free amino acid in the hemolymph (blood) of arthropods, playing a role in osmoregulation and metabolism. |
| Heptadecanoic Acid | Saturated Fatty Acid (C17:0) - Odd-chain | Contributes to membrane fluidity and function in a way that is debated but may be associated with improved fluidity compared to some even-chain SFAs. | Part of the general fatty acid profilein crustaceans, serving as a component of complex lipids essential for energy storage and structural components during key physiological processes like molting and reproduction. |
| Salicylic Acid | Not a fatty acid (It is a phenolic acid/phytohormone) | Induces changes in plant cells' vacuolar pH and can disrupt the polarity of certain auxin transporters on the plasma membrane in plants. | Primarily known as a plant defense signaling molecule (phytohormone); in arthropods (like insects), it can be toxic or a deterrent against herbivores feeding on SA-induced plants. |
| Stearic Acid | Saturated Fatty Acid (C18:0) | Increases the rigidity and order of the lipid bilayer by packing tightly with other saturated lipids, affecting membrane fluidity. | A major structural component of cell membranes and a source of body fuel; its presence is significant in the muscle tissues of crustaceans, such as crabs. |
| Terephthalic Acid | Not a fatty acid (It is a benzenedicarboxylic acid) | No direct structural role; a breakdown product of PET plastic, it requires specific transporter proteins (e.g., TphC in bacteria) to cross the cell membrane for metabolism. | A degradation product of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) plastic; gut microbes in some arthropods (e.g., Hymenoptera, mealworms) possess enzymes and transport systems to metabolize it. |

> provide links to journal articles.

### Making sense of the information

Alright I now have a list of papers. The results/trends seem mainly in
line with what I pulled out of Google Scholar searches. It provides me
links to various articles, but sometimes the author information is
incorrect even if the journal and article titles are correct. Senthil
Kumar et al. (2015) doesn't seem to exist at all, which was used to
justify the role of heptadecanoic and stearic acids in the crustacean
cell membranes. "Polyamines in mammalian skeletal muscle," "The
Polyamines: Critical Molecules for Reproduction and Development in
Aquatic Crustaceans," and "Spermidine Ameliorates Physiological Changes
in Skeletal Muscle after Injury in Mice" also don't exist, so I need to
confirm the roles of putresciene and spermidine in muscle contraction.

### Conclusions

The reason I am looking into these molecules is because they were
present in a module significantly correlated with 30ºC and righting
response. Elevated abundance of these molecules were found in 30ºC, and
their high abundance is significantly correlated with faster righting
response time. Overall, Gemini was good as a good launchpad, but I still had to put in substantial work into reviewing the citations provided (then finding my own since it hallucinated so much). I'm not sure if it actually saved me any time or not.

-   adipic acid: No role in cell membrane, which tracks with my previous
    Google Scholar searches.
-   arachidic acid: precursor to arachidonic acid, which is what is
    important for the cell membrane
-   glutamic acid: part of membrane proteins, neurotransmitter for
    skeletal muscle contractions
-   heptadecanoic acid: membrane fluidity and function, energy storage
    in crustaceans
-   salicylic acid: impair behavior and heart rate as a pollutant, could
    be suggestive of inability to cope with 30ºC long-term
-   stearic acid: provides more structure/reduced fluidity in the
    membrane, significant presence in crustacean tisue
-   terephthalic acid: industrial chemical, no clear relationship to
    righting response
-   putrescine: foul odor of dying flesh (yum), could tie in nicely with
    elevated mortality. polyamine (role in muscle contraction
    regulation)
-   spermidine: polyamine (role in muscle contraction regulation)

### Going forward
