### Back Burner

I haven't worked on these projects in a while, but they are next on my to-do list. I don't think they need to be in the deep freeze so I guess I gotta turn the back burner on!

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

- Revise `methylKit code`
- Run `bismark` with the new *C. gigas* genome
- Update methods and results
- Revise discussion
- Revise introduction
- Revise abstract

### Deep Freeze

Things that are not immediate enough to be on the backburner, so they're stuck in the deep freeze.

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

These are things I need to do and can probably knock out in a week, but I think they're a lower priority right now for me since there's more momentum on other projects. At the very least, I need to reach out to collaborators and get this going again.

- Revise abstract
- Write discussion
- Write introduction
