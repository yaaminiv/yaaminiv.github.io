## Treatment Days 40-43

**8/7/23**:

- Quick vacuum and feed
- No mortalities!
  - T1: 9
  - T2: 9
  - T3: 9
  - T4: 10
  - T5: 8
  - T6: 6
  - T7: 8
  - T8: 8
  - T9: 6

**8/8/23**:

- Home sick, so Sarah checked on the crabs for me
- Notes from Sarah
  - Changed filters in all tanks
  - Partial water change on T3 and T6 since they were very cloudy
- No mortalities!
  - T1: 9
  - T2: 9
  - T3: 9
  - T4: 10
  - T5: 8
  - T6: 6
  - T7: 8
  - T8: 8
  - T9: 6
- Labelled tubes. A few discrepancies
  - 25-048 listed as sampled, but was measured two weeks ago?. 25-047 not measured since 7/3 --> something weird
      - Could be that 25-048 and 25-047 were mixed up, especially if the labels were not as clear. They were both males and 25-048 was only 3 mm larger than 25-047.
      - Based on weight, 25-048 listed on 7/26/23 was actually 25-047! I made this correction in the Google Sheet
  - 15-099 listed as sampled, but measured 2 weeks ago. Is 15-093 alive instead?
      - Based on weight, 15-093 was sampled on 7/26. I made this correction in the Google Sheet.
  - T6 survivorship says six crabs, but seven crabs measured two week sago?

**8/9/23**:

- Still home sick, so Sarah and Sara being the rockstars they are shut down the 15ºC and 25ºC tanks. This means, TTR for all crabs, respirometry for our designated crabs, and dissections for everyone. They. are. rockstars.
- Ammonia checks and 60% water change for 5ºC tanks, since those are going to continue for an extra week
- Notes from Sarah
  - Crab 15-096/probe 3 on tank 5; chamber was removed from tank at 75% but upon removal it jumped back up to 77, so we put it back in and waited for it to drop to 75 again. Chamber was never opened and crab never removed.
  - Not sure what tank...but #25-107 didn't seem to exist. But 25-118 seemed to (tags were unclear but based on size and sex) in spite of not being on the datasheets for today. So, 25-118 (presumed) was put in tubes labelled 25-107. Additionally 25-108 did not exist.
    - Double checked, and [25-107 died on 7/27/23](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2023-Part14/). The survivorship spreadsheet is correct! That solves my issue from yesterday too.
    - 25-118 should be alive (last measured 7/19/23 and never reported dead). I made a note that the sample is in tubes labelled 25-107.
    - 25-108 not found on 8/9/23. [That tracks because it died 7/12/23 after we took its TTR (lol)](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2023-Part10/).
  - also, we forgot to stop recording before dumping background for the middle 25 treatment tank. So you'll have to manually trim that data. (we think it was that tank, forgot to write it down, but it should be fairly clear from the lines)
- Salinities
  - T2: 35
  - T3: 33
  - T5: 35
  - T6: 33
  - T8: 35
  - T9: 32
- No mortalities!
  - T1: 9
  - T4: 10
  - T7: 8

**8/10/23**:

- Back at work! TTR, respirometry, and dissection of two crabs for all 5ºC tanks
- 5-070 dead in T1. Two crabs sampled per tank
  - T1: 6
  - T4: 8
  - T7: 6
- Salinity
  - T1: 36.5
  - T4: 36.5
  - T7: 36.5

### Going forward

1. Continue doing daily checks and with experimental time points
2. Assist Lauren and Julia with final presentations
2. Test formatting and analysis for one set of respirometry data
7. Respirometry analysis
8. Update methods
9. Update results
