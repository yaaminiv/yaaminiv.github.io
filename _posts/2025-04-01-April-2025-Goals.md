It's the final countdown for SO. MANY. THINGS. this month! I need to be confronted with this ransom note-style threat every time I close my eyes.

### [March Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/March-2025-Goals/)

**Cold Acclimation Green Crab Experiment**:

Found out midway through this month that my manuscript deadline was April 15, and not May 1! I spent most of my time this month working on this project.

- [Finished genotyping WA crabs](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2024-Part34/) and [revised TTR data based on updated WA genotypes](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2024-Part35/)!
- [Genotyped Catlin's crabs](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2024-Part37/)!
- [Analyzed water temperature data for WA and Julia's experiment](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2024-Part38/)
- [Revised modeling for 2024 and Julia's experiments](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2024-Part39/)
- [Conducted population comparison for 2024 experiments](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2024-Part40/)
- Updated methods and results

**West Coast Green Crab Experiment**:

- [Sorted through notes to understand which crabs were sampled and resolve inconsistencies](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2023-Part59/)
- [Identified samples for metabolomics and transcriptomics sequencing](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2023-Part59/)
- Identified library prepration method and ordered samples
- Identified transcriptomics sequencing facility
- Reorganized -80ºC
- Cleaned the RNA room
- [Started RNA extractions](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2023-Part60/)

**Perspective Piece**:

- Finished writing 3/4 of manuscript text
- Created plan for boxes and figures
- Identified key words for Web of Science and ProQuest searches

### April Goals

**Cold Acclimation Green Crab Experiment**:

- Revise temperature data analysis
- Analyze Catlin's TTR data with genotype
- Analyze Catlin's temperature data
- Finalize methods and results
- Outline introduction
- Write introduction
- Outline discussion
- Write introduction
- Revise abstract
- Send to co-authors
- Submit to ICB!

**West Coast Green Crab Experiment**:

- Move RNA samples for extraction to the RNA room -20ºC
- Extract all RNA samples
- Find and consolidate all metabolomics samples
- Send metabolomics samples for seqeuencing
- Test library preparation kit
- Prepare sample libraries
- Send RNA libraries for sequencing

**Perspective Piece**:

- Finish writing
- Finish literature searches
- Make boxes and figures
- Send to collaborators for review
- Identify funds for open access publishing

### Back Burner

I haven't worked on these projects in a while, but they are next on my to-do list. I don't think they need to be in the deep freeze so I guess I gotta turn the back burner on!

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- Finish -omics integration analysis
- Finish -omics and physiology integration analysis
- Update methods
- Update results
- Write discussion
- Write introduction
- Write abstract

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

- Revise `methylKit code`
- Run `bismark` with the new *C. gigas* genome
- Update methods and results
- Revise discussion
- Revise introduction
- Revise abstract

### Deep Freeze

Things that are not immediate enough to be on the backburner, so they're stuck in the deep freeze.

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

These are things I need to do and can probably knock out in a week, but I think they're a lower priority right now for me since there's more momentum on other projects. At the very least, I need to reach out to collaborators and get this going again.

- Revise abstract
- Write discussion
- Write introduction
