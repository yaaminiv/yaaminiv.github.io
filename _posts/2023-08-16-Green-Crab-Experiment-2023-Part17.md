## Treatment Days 44-49

THE END.

**8/11/23**:

- No mortalities!
  - T1: 6
  - T4: 8
  - T7: 6
- Fed all tanks 1/8 tsp of food

**8/12/23**:

- No mortalities!
  - T1: 6
  - T4: 8
  - T7: 6
- Ammonia check and conditioner added when ammonia > 1.0. 60% of water replaced in all tanks
  - T1: 0.5
  - T4: 2.0
  - T7: 1.0
- Changed filters and fed all tanks 1/4 tsp of food so I wouldn't have to come in tomorrow

**8/14/23**:

- No mortalities!
  - T1: 6
  - T4: 8
  - T7: 6
- Fed all tanks 1/4 tsp of food so I wouldn't have to come in tomorrow
- Labelled tubes. Unknown status (not sure if alive or dead based on spreadsheet for the following crabs, seem like anomalies based on current survivorship)
  - T4: 5-066, 5-075
  - T7: 5-134

**8/16/23**:

- T1
  - Salinity: 39
  - 5-015: Guessed the crab number based on the final digit of the label, which was correct.
- T4
  - Salinity: 39
  - 5-066: NOT THERE. This makes sense! When I combed through the TTR spreadsheets and my old notes, I realized that 5-066 was sampled 7/5/23 and placed in a tube that said 5-060.
  - 5-068: Escaped after we did TTR! We found it hiding behind the dry ice cooler at the end of the experiment when we were cleaning up. Since it hung out for a while in air, sampling it for the experiment didn't make any sense.
  - 5-075: Sampled normally :)
  - Probe/chamber 2: switched during background because the fitting was coming off
- T7:
  - Salinity: 39
  - 5-134 â€”> NOT THERE. Makes sense because it died 7/23/23!

THE EXPERIMENT IS FINALLY DONE! I'm sure other things will come up as I clean data but for now it's time to sleep.

### Going forward

1. Assist Lauren and Julia with final presentations
2. Test formatting and analysis for one set of respirometry data
7. Respirometry analysis
8. Update methods
9. Update results
