I've never felt more seen by a government website. 

We're somehow in Week 7 of the quarter! Some things are chugging along well, other things are......maybe not chugging. Let's take some inventory.

### [October Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/October-2025-Goals/)

### October Goals

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- [Used ASCA analysis for individual -omic datasets](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-Part49/)
- [Realized I was missing some information in the methods and results, so I updated things](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-Part50/)
- [Used Gemini as a launch pad for targeted literature search](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-Part51/). It was a meh experience.
- I am SO CLOSE to having this discussion finished!

**Biol 1C**:

- We are chugging along (and thankfully we are no longer in the part that requires me to think a little too hard)

**Plan Biol 191**:

- Got my CDFW permit!
- Started purchasing molecular equipment!
- Priced out all physiology equipment!
- Sent Daryn list of class-specific equipment!
- Ordered the recirculating seawater system!
- Sorted through existing sample and falcon tubes!
- ........my poor syllabus is very neglected.

**West Coast Green Crab Experiment**:

- Revised [TTR](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2023-Part69/) and [respirometry](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2023-Part70/ data analyses
- Ignoring getting SCU cluster access for now since all my data is still on WHOI servers and it would be a pain to transfer things
- [Started to QC RNA-Seq data](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2023-Part71/). Forgot how long everything takes (especially when you are trying to remember how it works)
- Have not touched metabolomics data yet

**Other**:

- Finished IRB training modules for RIE2
- Got the RIE2 IRB approved!
- Finished the Generative AI course

### November Goals

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- Finish discussion
- Write introduction
- Write abstract
- Send draft to Carolyn!

**Plan Biol 191**:

- Draft syllabus
- Get syllabus feedback and revise
- Finalize equipment and fieldwork asks for course

**West Coast Green Crab Experiment**:

- Finish preliminary RNA-Seq analysis
- Finish preliminary metabolomics analysis

**Other**:

- Sort through -80ºC, -20ºC, and 4ºC
- Label and organize lab
- Finish ordering molecular equipment
- Finish ordering physiology equipment
- Network with green crab and oyster people in Northern California

### Back Burner

I haven't worked on these projects in a while, but they are next on my to-do list. I don't think they need to be in the deep freeze so I guess I gotta turn the back burner on!

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

- Revise `methylKit code`
- Run `bismark` with the new *C. gigas* genome
- Update methods and results
- Revise discussion
- Revise introduction
- Revise abstract

### Deep Freeze

Things that are not immediate enough to be on the backburner, so they're stuck in the deep freeze.

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

These are things I need to do and can probably knock out in a week, but I think they're a lower priority right now for me since there's more momentum on other projects. At the very least, I need to reach out to collaborators and get this going again.

- Revise abstract
- Write discussion
- Write introduction
