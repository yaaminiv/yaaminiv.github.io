I've officially started my new position as an Assistant Professor of Biology at Santa Clara University! Students start later this month, and I have quite a bit of work to do before they arrive. I'm excited, but also very terrified and I think that's probably a good thing. I won't with a [July Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/July-2025-Goals/) since most of my work involved finishing up library prep.

### September Goals

**Onboarding**:

- Complete all necessary trainings
- Set up office
- Reorganize existing lab equipment
- Order new lab materials

**Teaching**:

- Review 1C lab structure
- Survive the first few lab sections!

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- Revise demographic analysis for TTR
- Revise demographic analysis for respirometry
- Finish -omics integration analysis
- Finish -omics and physiology integration analysis
- Update methods
- Update results
- Outline discussion
- Write discussion

**Other**:

- Update my website
- Update SCU web profile
- Make Bluesky
- Join New PI Slack

### Back Burner

I haven't worked on these projects in a while, but they are next on my to-do list. I don't think they need to be in the deep freeze so I guess I gotta turn the back burner on!

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

- Revise `methylKit code`
- Run `bismark` with the new *C. gigas* genome
- Update methods and results
- Revise discussion
- Revise introduction
- Revise abstract

### Deep Freeze

Things that are not immediate enough to be on the backburner, so they're stuck in the deep freeze.

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

These are things I need to do and can probably knock out in a week, but I think they're a lower priority right now for me since there's more momentum on other projects. At the very least, I need to reach out to collaborators and get this going again.

- Revise abstract
- Write discussion
- Write introduction
