Week 10 of the quarter! Two more weeks of academic instruction before free-for-all time begins! It feels incorrect that we are here and yet here were are!!!!! Time to lay down like Syril.

### [November Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/November-2025-Goals/)

### November Goals

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

- FINISHED MY DRAFT MANUSCRIPT AND SENT IT TO CAROLYN!

**Plan Biol 191**:

- Finalized my syllabus!
- Sent a list of equipment to purchase for the course

**West Coast Green Crab Experiment**:

- [Came up with an analysis plan for the RNA-Seq data](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2023-Part74/)
- [Fought for my life in order to get `trinity` running](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2023-Part76/)
- Performed [exploratory PCA and perMANOVA analyses](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2023-Part72/), [reviewed potential outliers](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2023-Part73/), and [performed exploratory beta dispersion tests](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2023-Part75/)
- Performed PLDAS for [temperature and time](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2023-Part75/) and [temperature and genotype](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2023-Part77/)
- [Performed ASCAs for temperature and time and temperature and genotype](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2023-Part77/)

**Other**:

- Ordered molecular equipment!
- Networked with other green crab people in Elkhorn Slough

### December Goals

**West Coast Green Crab Experiment**:

- Finish initial metabolomics analysis
- Complete transcriptome assembly
- Global gene expression differences by temperature, time, and genotype
- SICB talk

**Plan Biol 191**:

- Order physiology equipment
- Update Camino site
- Create rubrics for assignments
- Sign up for Camino accesbility course

**Other**:

- Sort through -80ºC, -20ºC, and 4ºC
- Label and organize lab

### Back Burner

I haven't worked on these projects in a while, but they are next on my to-do list. I don't think they need to be in the deep freeze so I guess I gotta turn the back burner on!

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

- Revise `methylKit code`
- Run `bismark` with the new *C. gigas* genome
- Update methods and results
- Revise discussion
- Revise introduction
- Revise abstract

### Deep Freeze

Things that are not immediate enough to be on the backburner, so they're stuck in the deep freeze.

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

These are things I need to do and can probably knock out in a week, but I think they're a lower priority right now for me since there's more momentum on other projects. At the very least, I need to reach out to collaborators and get this going again.

- Revise abstract
- Write discussion
- Write introduction
