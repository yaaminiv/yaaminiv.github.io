YIKES I haven't made a goals post yet this year! January was a blur with SICB, vacation, and a job interview. February was devoted to labwork. So let's see where things stand? And of course, outline the many overlapping goals I have for this month.

### [December Goals Recap](https://yaaminiv.github.io/December-2024-Goals/)

**Cold Acclimation Green Crab Experiment**:

- Ran into several hiccups, but FINALLY [finished genotyping MA crabs in February](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2024-Part33/)!
- [Genotyped WA crabs that were alive for the whole experiment in December](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2024-Part27/)! Made good [progress on the remaining crabs in February](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2024-Part33/).
- [Incorporated genotype into preliminary MA TTR analysis](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2024-Part28/)
- [Incorporated genotype into preliminary WA TTR analysis](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Green-Crab-Experiment-2024-Part29/)

**Green Crab Pilot Experiment**:

I HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING FOR THIS AND IT MAKES ME SAD.

**NSF Grant**:

- Finalized project summary!
- Shared the project summary with a program officer at SICB
- Then all hell broke loose with the new administration so this grant writing is being tabled indefinitely

**West Coast Green Crab Experiment**:

- Budgeted remaining NSF money
- Started getting quotes for metabolomics and transcriptomics sequencing

**Other**:

- Presented a talk on the 2024 data at SICB!
- Started on the ICB perspective paper
- Started on the ICB genotype and acute stress paper
- [Re-familiarized myself with the Hawaii paper for an April aquaculture special issue](https://yaaminiv.github.io/Hawaii-Gigas-Methylation-Analysis-Part23/)
- GOT A JOB OFFER AND SUCCESSFULLY NEGOTIATED AND SIGNED!! More on that in a future lab notebook post

### March Goals

**West Coast Green Crab Experiment**:

- Identify samples for metabolomics and transcriptomics sequencing
- Send metabolomics samples out for sequencing
- Identify transcriptomics sequencing facility
- Pay for transcriptomics services before March 25
- Clean the RNA room
- Start RNA extractions

**Perspective Piece**:

- Finish manuscript text

**Hawaii Gigas Methylation**:

- Revise `methylKit code`
- Run `bismark` with the new *C. gigas* genome
- Update methods and results
- Revise discussion
- Revise introduction
- Revise abstract

### Deep Freeze

Things that are not immediate enough to be on the backburner, so they're stuck in the deep freeze.

**Coral Transcriptomics**:

These are things I need to do and can probably knock out in a week, but I think they're a lower priority right now for me since there's more momentum on other projects. At the very least, I need to reach out to collaborators and get this going again.

- Revise abstract
- Write discussion
- Write introduction
